     * <code>DOMEntityResolver</code> Provides a way for applications to redirect 
     * references to external entities.
     * <p>Applications needing to implement customized handling for external 
     * entities must implement this interface and register their implementation 
     * by setting the <code>entityResolver</code> attribute of the 
     * <code>DOMBuilder</code>. 
     * <p>The <code>DOMBuilder</code> will then allow the application to intercept 
     * any external entities (including the external DTD subset and external 
     * parameter entities) before including them.
     * <p>Many DOM applications will not need to implement this interface, but it 
     * will be especially useful for applications that build XML documents from 
     * databases or other specialized input sources, or for applications that 
     * use URNs. <code>DOMEntityResolver</code> is based on the SAX2  
     * <code>EntityResolver</code> interface. 
     * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20020725'>IDocument Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
    and Save Specification</a>.

         * the external DTD subset, external entities referenced within the DTD, 
         * and external entities referenced within the document element); the 
         * application may request that the <code>DOMBuilder</code> resolve the 
         * entity itself, that it use an alternative URI, or that it use an 
         * entirely different input source.
         * <br>Application writers can use this method to redirect external system 
         * identifiers to secure and/or local URIs, to look up public 
         * identifiers in a catalogue, or to read an entity from a database or 
         * other input source (including, for example, a dialog box).
         * <br>If the system identifier is a URI, the <code>DOMBuilder</code> must 
         * resolve it fully before reporting it to the application through this 
         * interface. See issue #4. An alternative would be to pass the URI out 
         * without resolving it, and to provide a base as an additional 
         * parameter. SAX resolves URIs first, and does not provide a base. 
         * @param publicId The public identifier of the external entity being 
         *   referenced, or <code>null</code> if none was supplied.
         * @param systemId The system identifier, a URI reference , of the 
         *   external entity being referenced exactly as written in the source. 
         * @param baseURI The absolute base URI of the resource being parsed, or 
         *   <code>null</code> if there is no base URI. 
         * @return A <code>IDOMInputSource</code> object describing the new input 
         *   source, or <code>null</code> to request that the parser open a 
         *   regular URI connection to the system identifier.
