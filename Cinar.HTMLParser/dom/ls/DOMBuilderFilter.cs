     * <code>DOMBuilderFilter</code>s provide applications the ability to examine 
     * nodes as they are being constructed during a parse. As each node is 
     * examined, it may be modified or removed, or the entire parse may be 
     * terminated early. 
     * <p>At the time any of the filter methods are called by the parser, the 
     * owner IDocument and DOMImplementation objects exist and are accessible. 
     * The document element is never passed to the <code>DOMBuilderFilter</code> 
     * methods, i.e. it is not possible to filter out the document element. The 
     * <code>IDocument</code>, <code>DocumentType</code>, <code>Notation</code>, 
     * and <code>Entity</code> nodes are not passed to the filter.
     * <p>All validity checking while reading a document occurs on the source 
     * document as it appears on the input stream, not on the DOM document as it 
     * is built in memory. With filters, the document in memory may be a subset 
     * of the document on the stream, and its validity may have been affected by 
     * the filtering.
     * <p> All default content, including default attributes, must be passed to 
     * the filter methods. 
     * <p> Any exception raised in the filter are ignored by the 
     * <code>DOMBuilder</code>. The description of these methods is not complete
     * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20020725'>IDocument Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
    and Save Specification</a>.
